CP (Gecode dom_w_deg)	0s	0s	10s	100%
CP (Gecode most_constrained)	0s	0s	22s	100%
CP (Chuffed default)	0s	1s	TIMEOUT	66%
CP (Chuffed fail_first)	0s	0s	6s	100%
SMT (Z3)	0s	0s	7s	100%
MIP (PuLP CBC)	0s	2s	TIMEOUT	66%

2. Key Observations
Scalability:
The problem exhibits exponential complexity growth. While n=6 is trivially solved by all approaches (<1s), n=10 already causes timeouts for MIP and Chuffed default
CP with Gecode demonstrates the best scalability, with the default search strategy solving n=10 instantly
Search Strategy Impact (CP):
Search strategy choice has dramatic effects: Gecode's fail_first_indomain_min took 28s for n=8 but only 4s for n=10 - showing non-monotonic behavior due to randomness/problem structure
The dom_w_deg (domain over weighted degree) strategy shows good performance by focusing on heavily constrained variables
Chuffed default failed at n=10 (300s timeout) while fail_first_indomain_random succeeded in 6s - demonstrating that search heuristics are critical
Solver Comparison:
SMT (Z3) provides consistent, predictable performance across all instances with 100% success rate
MIP (PuLP CBC) struggles with larger instances due to the linearization overhead - the auxiliary variables needed to model team pairings (m1, m2 variables in the code) significantly increase the problem size
CP is the most natural paradigm for this scheduling problem due to native support for alldifferent and global_cardinality constraints

3. Model Complexity Analysis

Paradigm	Variables (n=10)	Constraint Style
CP	~135 integer variables	Declarative global constraints
SMT	~90 integer variables + Boolean auxiliaries	Sequential encoding for cardinality
MIP	~450+ binary variables (4D array + auxiliary)	Linearized quadratic constraints

The MIP formulation requires 4-5x more variables than CP/SMT due to:
Binary encoding of team assignments
Auxiliary variables (m1, m2) to linearize the "team plays each other exactly once" constraint

4. Constraint Modeling Differences
Each-pair-once constraint:
CP: Elegant boolean sum with /\ and \/ operators
SMT: Sequential encoding using auxiliary Boolean variables
MIP: Requires linearization with additional binary variables and 3 constraints per auxiliary

5. Conclusions
CP is optimal for this tournament scheduling problem - native global constraints (alldifferent, global_cardinality_low_up) map directly to the problem structure
Search strategy matters more than solver choice - a poorly chosen heuristic can cause timeout even with an efficient solver (Chuffed default vs. fail_first)
SMT provides robustness - Z3's internal heuristics found solutions consistently without manual strategy tuning
MIP's linearization overhead becomes prohibitive - the quadratic nature of the "each team plays each other once" constraint fundamentally disadvantages MIP approaches
Symmetry breaking is implemented in all models (home team < away team for first week) and helps reduce search space
